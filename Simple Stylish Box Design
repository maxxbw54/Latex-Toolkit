\begin{document}
{\LARGE Simple Box} % inspired by https://saruwakakun.com/html-css/reference/box
\begin{multicols}{2}
A. Just enclose with a solid line.

\begin{boxA}
It is just a frame surrounded by a slightly thick line. A simple monochrome design might be fine, but when you want a gorgeous look, it's a bit unsatisfactory.
\end{boxA}

B. Rounded Corner

\begin{boxB}
We changed the color and made the corners round. Change the text color, line color, and roundness of the corners as necessary.
\end{boxB}

C. Background Fill

\begin{boxC}
I tried to fill the background without using lines. Please change the background color to your liking.
\end{boxC}

D. Only Top and Bottom Line

\begin{boxD}
In addition to filling, I added thicker lines to the top and bottom. It is important to choose a color that is compatible with the lines and background.
\end{boxD}

E. Double Line Border

\begin{boxE}
A double-lined frame. You can create it by specifying multiple "borderline". The last argument in \texttt{borderline} is essentially work the same as \texttt{tikz} options.
\end{boxE}

F. Dashed Box

\begin{boxF}
I made the surrounding frame a broken line. Change the line thickness to your liking (just adjust the first argument in \texttt{borderline}).
\end{boxF}

G. Left and Right Double Line

\begin{boxG}
I tried adding a double line only to the left and right. We recommend changing the color according to your document design.
\end{boxG}

H. Thick Line Only to the left

\begin{boxH}
It is a sticky note box design. You may use it to write important points or supplementary notes in the article.
\end{boxH}

I. Thick line only on top

\begin{boxI}
This is the case when I added a line only to the top. The point is to put together the background and line/character colors in the same system color overall.
\end{boxI}

J. If You Cast a Shadow...

\begin{boxJ}
It looks like a little floating with a shadow. Although it has a mint color scheme, the background may be white or gray.
\end{boxJ}

K. Smart Design

\begin{boxK}
The box area is made visible by the shadow instead of the border. The top line may be placed on the left (replace border-top with border-left).
\end{boxK}

L. Thick Board Style

\begin{boxL}
The underline is slightly darker than the background to express the thickness. The neck is that it looks a little like a button.
\end{boxL}

M. Thick Board with Shadow

\begin{boxM}
I added a shadow to give it a more three-dimensional appearance. It's a little flashy, so it might be good to use it on the part you really want to stand out.
\end{boxM}
